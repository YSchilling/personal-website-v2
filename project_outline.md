# Goal of the Website

The website should give visitors a feel for who I am and what my qualities are. My target audience includes other entrepreneurs, possible customers and also HR people from big tech companys.

# Which story do I want to tell?

# Content

- tl;dr about me and my experience
- my story
  - where it all started (hobby programming)
  - how I got introduced to entrepreneurship
- what are my current interests/projects/learning topics

# UX / UI Design

- one pager, better for visual story telling
- I could make a line like graphic that guides the user through my story to my current interests
- my content introduces a duality, computer science and entrepreneurship, I could highlight this with 2 different colors that complement each other
